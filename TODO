  - More distributions supported by survregmin
  - Parallelise main simulation loop
  - Default incidence model handle multiple stratas
  - Add in docs for generic methods for incidence and survival models (export them?)
  - Have predict_survival_probability.survregmin not require factors to manually have their original levels added

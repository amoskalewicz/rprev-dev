  - More rigorous stress testing!
  - Improve poisson_sim_fit plot with Simon's updated formulated of deviation from smooth
  - Rename incidence functions?
  - Make incidence object which is built with 1 function (incidence...), and has p-values as attributes, and 1 plot method with 2 arguments detailing to plot as the possion_sim_fit or the inspect_incidence existing functions?!

  - Parallelise main simulation loop
  - Add in docs for generic methods for incidence and survival models (export them?)
  - Have predict_survival_probability.survregmin not require factors to manually have their original levels added
  - Provide cure model implementation using the previously used model
  - Provide simulated data set with cure fraction

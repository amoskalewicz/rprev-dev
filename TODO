  - More rigorous stress testing!
  - Improve functional_form_age to only plot rcs and return 2 summaries, working with rms loading!
  - Summary and print methods for survfit.prev object
  - Agree with Simon best way to display plot.survfit.prev
  - See if there's a way to get rms package working without the datadist <<- stuff, as it messes up scope!
  - Get functional_form_age working correctly with imports

  - Sort importing packages issue, if use "imports" in DESCRIPTION then how to actually import functions? I.e. if run library(prevR) then survival doesn't get loaded
  - Rename prevalence attributes (i.e. 'samples' not very descriptive)
  - Redo prev_chisq to apply to prevalence object
  - Rename meanIR to mean_incidence_rate? Or even something more descriptive, as meanIR implies it just calculates the mean when the main selling point is its standard error estimation
  - Remove data types from incidence docs

  - Write unit tests for the simulated dataset
  - Error handling when index date (as determined by start_date + num_years) is far greater than last incident case. How to know if this is an error or just due to chance with a really low incidence rate? Could just be a warning instead? This is used in several functions across incidence and prevalence
  - Include unit tests to test when errors or warnings are raised?
  - Is it necessary to include type and length checks, or are these tested for with expect_equal_to_reference?
  - Change registry_survival_bootstrapped to work with datasets with only one sex, by adding the fake sex level to the data passed to this function rather than using the hack at the moment to remove the coefficients
  - Rename num_years and N_years to more specifically describe the differences, i.e. N_years -> num_estimated_years, num_years -> num_registry_years
  - Guard when trying to estimate prevalence for more years than registry, or warning at least and truncate it?

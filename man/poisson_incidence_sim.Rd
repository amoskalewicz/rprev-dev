\title{Inspect consistency of incidence rate with an homogeneous Poisson process using simulation.}
\usage{
poisson_incidence_sim(object, N_sim = 1000, level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A \code{cincidence} object.}

\item{N_sim}{Number of draws from a homogeneous Poisson process.}

\item{level}{The desired confidence interval width.}
}
\value{
Plot of the smoothed incidence function and corresponding deviations.
}
\description{
This function generates a plot where the red line is the deviation of cumulative diagnoses
from the fitted smooth taken from the incidence object. In order to ascertain if the deviation
is within reasonable bounds, simulation is used. The grey lines represent N draws from a
uniform distribution between 0 and the last day of diagnosis, where N is the number of incident
cases, plotted as deviations from a smooth fitted to them. The blue lines are 95\% confidence
intervals drawn from the simulated data.
